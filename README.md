# AETHER AI — Multi-Model Intelligence Council

## Capstone Project Title
**AETHER AI: A Multi-Model Intelligence Council for Truth-Oriented AI Decision Making**

---

## Project Idea

AETHER AI is a multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to improve the quality, reliability, and trustworthiness of AI-generated outputs.

Instead of relying on a single AI model, AETHER AI creates a *council of multiple AI models* (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, etc.). Each model independently receives the same task and generates its own solution. These solutions are then **cross-verified, critiqued, and evaluated** by other AI agents in a blind-review process.

A central decision-making agent, called the **Aether Arbiter**, analyzes all outputs and verification results to produce **one final, optimized, and high-confidence solution**.

The goal of AETHER AI is not just to generate answers, but to **refine intelligence through collective reasoning**, reducing hallucinations, bias, and single-model limitations.

## Key Objectives

- Build a multi-model AI orchestration system
- Enable blind cross-verification between AI agents
- Improve correctness, consistency, and reliability of AI outputs
- Demonstrate system design, architecture, and full-stack development skills
- Apply real-world AI governance and decision-making principles

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **Architecture:** Multi-agent orchestration system
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Capstone Day-by-Day Plan

### Day 1 – Project Setup & Planning
- Create GitHub repository
- Define project idea and architecture
- Set up README and documentation
- Create initial project folder structure

### Day 2 – Frontend Setup
- Initialize Next.js project with Tailwind CSS
- Create base layout (Topbar, Sidebar, Panels)
- Implement basic UI structure for dashboard

### Day 3 – Backend Setup
- Set up FastAPI backend
- Create basic API endpoints
- Establish frontend–backend communication

### Day 4 – Aether Council Implementation
- Define AI agent interfaces
- Simulate multiple AI model responses
- Standardize input/output formats

### Day 5 – Verification & Arbiter Logic
- Implement cross-verification logic
- Add scoring and evaluation mechanisms
- Design Arbiter decision-making flow

### Day 6 – Integration & Testing
- Integrate frontend with backend logic
- Test multi-agent workflows
- Fix bugs and edge cases

### Day 7 – Documentation & Final Review
- Update documentation and diagrams
- Final testing and optimization
- Prepare project for capstone submission

## Expected Outcome

By the end of the capstone project, AETHER AI will demonstrate how collective intelligence from multiple AI models can be orchestrated to produce more reliable and high-quality results than any single model alone.
